  abstractNote={A new metaheuristic for (combinatorial) optimization is
                  presented: memetic algorithms with population management or
                  MA|PM. An MA|PM is a memetic algorithm, that combines local
                  search and crossover operators, but its main distinguishing
                  feature is the use of distance measures for population
                  management. Population management strategies can be developed
                  to dynamically control the diversity of a small population of
                  high-quality individuals, thereby avoiding slow or premature
                  convergence, and achieve excellent performance on hard
                  combinatorial optimization problems. The new algorithm is
                  tested on two problems: the multidimensional knapsack problem
                  and the weighted tardiness single-machine scheduling problem.
                  On both problems, population management is shown to be able to
                  improve the performance of a similar memetic algorithm without
                  population management.},
